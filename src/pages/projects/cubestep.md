## Description
A collaboration between JPL and Cal Poly Pomona to develop a CubeSat platform that can support future payloads. The project focuses on using additive manufacturing to make the platform adaptable for different mission needs and on developing and testing a thermal management system using oscillating heat pipes (OHPs) provided by JPL.

## Role
Harness Responsible Engineer, On-Board Computer (OBC) Subsystem Lead

## Problem Statement
My main challenges are identifying all electrical connections between subsystems, determining cable lengths and routing, and becoming the technical point of contact for the OBC so that other team members working on flight hardware can specialize while keeping the team’s efforts coordinated.

## Process / Methodology
I maintain a detailed spreadsheet to track component connections and cable lengths. Using SolidWorks Electrical Routing, I modeled cable paths and determined lengths, then added appropriate slack based on NASA’s workmanship standards (EEE-INST-002).

## Results
The project is ongoing and just entering the integration and testing phase.

## Images
Due to an NDA, I am unable to share images of the design models or documentation.
